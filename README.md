# Bible Reading Plan Tracker

This is a simple web app designed to help users track progress through a long-term Bible reading plan. The plan spans **195 weeks** and cycles through the entire Bible with an emphasis on repeated readings of the New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs.

## Features

-  Displays weekly Bible reading assignments
-  Allows users to mark each week as complete
-  Automatically loads the first incomplete week on refresh
-  Progress is saved using `localStorage`
-  Export reading progress to a `.json` file
-  Import previously saved progress with preview and confirmation
-  Reset all progress (with button disabled when there's nothing to reset)
-  Progress bar shows percentage completed
-  Accessible and responsive UI
-  Expandable section explaining the reading plan

## Background

This app was created as a personal project to digitize and enhance a custom Bible reading plan originally managed in a spreadsheet. The goal was to create a tool that is simple, focused, and accessible â€” designed to help users maintain long-term progress without overwhelming features or unnecessary complexity.

## Roadmap

Planned or potential future improvements include:

- [ ] Option to adjust the reading start week
- [ ] Support for alternate reading plans
- [ ] Ability to annotate or take notes on each week
- [ ] Cloud sync or account-based saving (beyond localStorage)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
